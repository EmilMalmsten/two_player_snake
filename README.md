# 1v1 snake

A 1v1 snake game where each snake keeps growing. Be the last one alive as space keeps getting more and more limited. Idea comes from one of the first online games I played as a kid on a Swedish game site called Blip.se

Built in Python with Tkinter as a portfolio project and learning experience for myself.
